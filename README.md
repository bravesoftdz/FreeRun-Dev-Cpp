# FreeRun-Dev-Cpp
FreeRun Dev C++ is a port of Dev C++ to Github, with the intent of updating the Delphi/Object Pascal codebase to Use the Free Pascal Compiler. This project is licensed under the GPL v2.  
The benefits of this project, over the standard Delphi codebase for Dev C++, is that Free Pascal is a Open Source Language, not requiring a Propretiary license, to make the project with, hence its "Free to Run". 
Another benefit of using the Free Pascal Compiler, and updating the code base, is that within reason (depending on the updates to GCC) The project is more portable and able to be used on more architectures.
